#Sudoku
This project was designed to create a program that can solve any sudoku puzzle. It uses the tactic of "recursive backtracking" paired with a brute force approach to solve the puzzle. Essentially the program goes through each of the cells and tries a number between 1-9 that fits the constraints the game. Once it finds that it is unable to place a number, the program goes back to the initial place where the error was created and replaces it with a different number. This is repeated until the program reaches the last possible cell at the end of the puzzle.
