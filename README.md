EVIL HANGMAN
this project aims to create an "evil" version of the hangman game. Rather than choosing a word at the beginning of the game based on the user's input of how many words they would like in the particular word, the computer only chooses the word once it "has" to. As the user enters choices, the computer creates sets of words based on the possible patterns. Then, based on the difficulty level assigned, it selects the "hardest" possible sets based on number of words in each set, which pattern reveals the least letters, and the ASCII value of each pattern.
